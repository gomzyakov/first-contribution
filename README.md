# First Contribution

This project will help you make your first contribution directly to GitHub via a web interface.

## Three steps to your first contribution

If you have never contributed code on GitHub before, this is the project to get you started:

1. __Open this file in editor__: In the upper-right corner of the file view, click the pencil icon to open the file editor.
1. __Make your changes__: Modify the content of the file. In the "First Time Contributors" section add a link to your GitHub account and a few words about yourself.
1. __Commit the changes__:
    - Type a clear and concise commit message in the "Commit message" field.
    - Optionally, add a more detailed description in the "Extended description" field.
    - Create a new branch and open a pull request.

After some time, [@gomzyakov](https://github.com/gomzyakov) will merge your PR. Congratulations! You have made _your first contribution_!
