# Your First Contribution

Help beginners make their first contribution on GitHub

## How? Incredibly simple!


Changing a File Directly on GitHub (Web Interface):

1. __Navigate to the file__: In your repository, browse to the specific file you want to change.
1. Open the editor: In the upper-right corner of the file view, click the pencil icon to open the file editor.
1. Make your changes: Modify the content of the file in the text area.
1. __Commit the changes__:
Type a clear and concise commit message in the "Commit message" field.
Optionally, add a more detailed description in the "Extended description" field.
Decide whether to commit directly to the current branch (for minor changes or if you are on a feature branch) or to create a new branch and open a pull request (recommended for significant changes or if working on the default branch).
